		<p class="intro">Australia's economy is deeply interconnected with the global market, and understanding its international trade dynamics provides valuable insight into the nation's economic resilience, dependencies, and opportunities for growth. This visualisation project — Australia's International Trade at a Glance — explores how Australia engages with its top trading partners, the balance between imports and exports, and the movement of goods and capital across regions.</p>

				<p>Australia's trade is heavily centred around the Asia-Pacific region, with China standing out as the country's largest trading partner by a significant margin. Both imports and exports between the two nations remain consistently high, showing how closely the two economies are connected. Japan, South Korea, and India are also key export destinations, mainly for resources like coal, iron ore, and gas, while the United States plays a major role in imports, particularly for technology and machinery. Overall, these trends highlight how Australia's economy is strongly tied to its regional neighbours, reflecting its role as a major supplier of raw materials and a consumer of manufactured goods.</p>
